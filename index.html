                <p>I am a baller. I am a shot caller. People sometimes ask me how I manage to be both, and although I don't always have an answer that I can explain in words, I just show them my portfolio and they begin to understand. <br><br>This website was created as a magnum opus of sorts - an example of the greatness of man, if you will. You may find yourself wondering "How did I end up here?" or "Why can't I leave?". The truth is, there is no real answer to either of these questions, besides the answer that you have to find yourself. Admiration. <br><br>It's not jealousy. It's just being in awe at something so great. It's natural and nobody can blame you.<br><br>My name is Alex Alvarado as you may have guessed from the name at the top of the page or just from taking a shot in the dark. It's a common name, but don't let that fool you. Everyone else that has this name is only borrowing, my usage is the one and only true application of the name. I work in marketing for biotechnology, and despite knowing how marketing strategies try to reach me, they end up convincing me to buy something every time. I am weak, but only in weakness is there strength. <br><br>Now that you know about me, it is only fair that I know about you. Write a letter describing yourself and drop it in your nearest mailbox. There is a non-zero chance that it reaches me, and then we will both know about each other.<br><br>Regards,<br>Alex</p>
