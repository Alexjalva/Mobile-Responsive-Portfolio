# Mobile-Responsive-Portfolio
##Portfolio website with code to adjust for mobile devices. 

A portfolio website is necessary to display work in an accessible and device responsive manner. The website contains three basic functions of a portfolio:an about section, a contact section, and a portfolio page.
Every page includes a footer for copyright and consistency, as well as a clean look. 
The navbar is consistent on every page. It allows users to go back and forth between the three pages and removes redundancy from navigating to the page they are currently on. 
Page sections are semantically labeled, images are alt tagged. The page is responsive to screen size changes and maintains a clean look on even large or very small pages.

##Installation

https://github.com/Alexjalva/Mobile-Responsive-Portfolio.git

All files needed are contained within the repository. The main folder needs to include the assets folder and all 3 html files. As long as all files are included, and placed in that order, the html should be able to find the images based on relative path. 

##Usage

###How to access the page
Webpage can be loaded based off of html in main repository. 

### How to Navigate the Website

The navbar has a brand on the left that is not clickable. The right side of the navbar, when expanded, will have three buttons. The button for the active page will not be clickable, the other two buttons will.

The navbar will become compact on smaller screens and will instead have a burger menu where the links previously were. The burger menu can be clicked on to access the other links as seen below.
